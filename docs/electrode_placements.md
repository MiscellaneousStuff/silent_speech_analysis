# Electrode Placements

## About

This document is a summary of different electrode placements across
different sEMG Silent Speech papers. At first this document will just
be filled with the different places on the face and throat authors
chose to place electrodes and will be filled with more details as
time goes on.

### Digital Voicing of Silent Speech, An Improved Model for Voicing Silent Speech

| No   | Location                            |
| ---- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1    | left cheek just above mouth         |
| 2    | left corner of chin                 |
| 3    | below chin below 3cm                |
| 4    | throat 3cm left from Adam's apple   |
| 5    | mid-jaw right                       |
| 6    | right cheek just below mouth        |
| 7    | right cheek 2cm from nose          |
| 8    | back of right cheek                 |
| ref  | below left ear                      |
| bias | below right ear                     |

Order of electrodes does not imply importance, these were just the numberings
of the electrodes within the data.

### AlterEgo: A Personalized Wearable Silent Speech Interface

| No   | Location            |
| ---- | ------------------- |
| 1    | Mental              | <!-- chin -->
| 2    | Inner laryngeal     | <!-- throat 3cm left from Adam's apple -->
| 3    | Outer laryngeal     | <!--  -->
| 4    | Hyoid               | <!-- below chin below 3cm -->
| 5    | Inner infra-orbital |
| 6    | Outer infra-orbital | <!-- right cheek 2cm from nose -->
| 7    | Buccal              | <!-- potential space in the cheek -->
| ref  | Wrist or earlobe    |

The order of electrodes for this paper are the rankings of how relevant
they were to classifying EMG signals into text within the papers pilot
user study. The most important region was the Mental region (i.e. the chin)
and the least important region was the Buccal (i.e. if you suck in your cheeks,
just below the most sucked in part of your cheeks).
